# Acme::Presume

Presume will allow one to execute a block of code, without the burden of strict
variable checking, seeing warnings, or worrying about failure. Code will execute
perfectly, within presume, every time.

There isn't one good reason this module should exist. Yet, here we are.

_*pre-sume* (v)_

1. suppose that something is the case on the basis of probability.

2. be audacious enough to do something.
